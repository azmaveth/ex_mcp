Based on the web search results I just gathered, I can see that the proposed architecture aligns perfectly with established patterns in the Elixir ecosystem. Let me synthesize the key insights and provide a refined architectural design:

## Validated Architecture Patterns

The search results confirm that the "central server with lightweight connection handlers" pattern is indeed the standard approach:

1. **Ranch Pattern**: Acceptor pool + lightweight connection processes
2. **Phoenix Channels**: Central channel process + transport processes per client  
3. **PubSub Broadcasting**: Registry-based message distribution

This validates our architectural direction. Now let me critically evaluate the design and propose refinements:

## Critical Analysis of Gemini's Proposal

**What's Correct:**
- Identifying the 1-to-1 coupling problem in current ExMCP.Server
- The three-transport strategy (:beam, :tcp_beam, :http)
- Using native BEAM distribution for trusted services
- Central server + lightweight connection pattern for TCP/HTTP

**What Needs Refinement:**
- The native BEAM transport doesn't need special handling in ExMCP.Server
- The refactoring scope might be too aggressive initially
- Missing consideration of existing API compatibility
- No discussion of migration strategy for users

## Refined Optimal Architecture Design

Let me design a more practical implementation that builds on existing code while achieving the performance goals. What specific aspects should I focus on:

1. Detailed module structure and interfaces?
2. Migration strategy from current architecture?
3. API design that maintains backwards compatibility?
4. Implementation phases and priorities?

What would be most valuable to flesh out first?
