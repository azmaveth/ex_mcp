# MCP Specification Compliance Summary

This document summarizes the MCP specification compliance features implemented in ExMCP.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Initialize Request Batch Validation ✅
- **Location**: `lib/ex_mcp/server.ex`
- **Spec Requirement**: The `initialize` request MUST NOT be part of a JSON-RPC batch
- **Implementation**: Added validation in `handle_request_for_batch/4` to reject initialize in batches

### 2. Audio Content Type Support ✅
- **Location**: `lib/ex_mcp/content.ex`, `lib/ex_mcp/types/v20250326.ex`
- **Spec Requirement**: Support for audio content type alongside text, image, and resource
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created `ExMCP.Content` module with `audio/3` function
  - Added `audio_content()` type definition
  - Created comprehensive audio example demonstrating transcription, TTS, and analysis

### 3. Completions Capability Declaration ✅
- **Location**: `lib/ex_mcp/version_registry.ex`
- **Spec Requirement**: Servers should declare completion capabilities with `hasArguments` and `values`
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added completion capability to version registry
  - Created completion example showing file path, color, and language completions

### 4. HTTP Transport Flexibility ✅
- **Location**: `lib/ex_mcp/transport/http.ex`
- **Spec Requirements**:
  - Session management with `Mcp-Session-Id` header
  - Support for non-SSE mode (single JSON responses)
  - Configurable endpoint (not hardcoded to `/mcp/v1`)
  - Resumability with Last-Event-ID
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `session_id` field with automatic generation
  - Added `use_sse` option (default: true)
  - Made endpoint configurable
  - Added Last-Event-ID support for resumability

### 5. Security Requirements Enforcement ✅
- **Location**: `lib/ex_mcp/security.ex`, `lib/ex_mcp/secure_server.ex`
- **Spec Requirements**:
  - Origin validation for DNS rebinding protection
  - HTTPS enforcement for non-localhost URLs
  - Localhost binding security
- **Implementation**:
  - Enhanced `ExMCP.Security` with validation functions
  - Updated `SecureServer` to enforce all security requirements
  - Created security example demonstrating all features

## Examples Created

1. **Audio Content Example** (`examples/audio_content_example.exs`)
   - Demonstrates audio transcription, text-to-speech, and audio analysis
   - Shows how to work with base64-encoded audio data
   - Includes resource management for generated audio

2. **Completion Example** (`examples/completion_example.exs`)
   - Shows argument autocompletion for tools
   - Demonstrates file path, color, and language code completion
   - Includes resource URI completion

3. **Security Example** (`examples/security_example.exs`)
   - Demonstrates origin validation (DNS rebinding protection)
   - Shows HTTPS enforcement
   - Illustrates localhost binding security
   - Covers authentication requirements

## Code Quality

- **Credo Issues**: 0 (all issues resolved)
- **Logger Warnings**: Fixed with proper metadata configuration
- **Format**: All code properly formatted

## Breaking Changes

- HTTP transport now uses session management by default
- The `Mcp-Session-Id` header is automatically included in all requests

## Version Support

ExMCP now fully supports:
- MCP 2024-11-05
- MCP 2025-03-26 
- Draft specification features (marked as experimental)

## Testing

All new features have been tested with:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for transport changes
- Example scripts demonstrating real-world usage

## Next Steps

To use these new features:

1. **Audio Content**: Use `ExMCP.Content.audio/3` to create audio content
2. **Completions**: Implement `handle_complete/3` in your server handler
3. **HTTP Sessions**: Session management is automatic, but you can provide a custom session ID
4. **Security**: Use `ExMCP.SecureServer` for production deployments
