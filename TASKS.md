## Notes

- The library implements the Model Context Protocol specification version 2024-11-05
- stdio transport is the primary transport mechanism, matching the reference implementation
- The client includes automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Server handlers can be implemented using the ExMCP.Server.Handler behaviour
- All protocol messages use string keys for JSON compatibility
