# MCP Compliance Test Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to organize and analyze MCP specification compliance tests.

## Test Organization

3. `spec_draft_test.exs` - Tests for draft MCP specification
4. `completion_compliance_test.exs` - Completion capability compliance
5. `logging_compliance_test.exs` - Logging functionality compliance
6. `pagination_compliance_test.exs` - Pagination compliance

10. `protocol_batch_test.exs` - Batch request functionality
11. `protocol_progress_test.exs` - Progress notification functionality
12. `protocol_notifications_test.exs` - Protocol notifications

#### New Compliance Tests Created
1. `protocol_compliance_test.exs` - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol compliance
2. `message_validation_compliance_test.exs` - MCP message validation requirements (11 skipped tests for missing features)
3. `batch_edge_cases_test.exs` - Batch request edge cases (10 skipped tests for missing features)
4. `cancellation_compliance_test.exs` - Cancellation protocol validation (extracted from cancellation_test.exs)
5. `version_negotiation_compliance_test.exs` - Version negotiation compliance (extracted from version_negotiation_test.exs)
6. `roots_compliance_test.exs` - Roots functionality protocol compliance (extracted from roots_simple_test.exs)
7. `security_compliance_test.exs` - MCP security requirements (extracted from security_origin_validation_test.exs, 2 skipped tests)

### Test Statistics

- **Total Compliance Tests**: 241 tests
- **Passing**: 218 tests
- **Failing**: 0 tests
- **Skipped**: 23 tests (for unimplemented features)
- **All tests tagged with**: `@moduletag :compliance`

### Running Compliance Tests

```bash
# Run only compliance tests
mix test --only compliance

# Run specific compliance test file
mix test test/ex_mcp/compliance/spec_2024_11_05_test.exs

# Exclude compliance tests
mix test --exclude compliance
```

## Coverage Analysis

Based on `MCP_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`, the current test coverage is:

### By Specification Version
- **2024-11-05**: ~63% coverage (31 fully tested, 15 missing)
- **2025-03-26**: ~61% coverage (42 fully tested, 21 missing)
- **Draft**: ~54% coverage (37 fully tested, 24 missing)

### High Priority Missing Tests

1. **Critical Security Features**
   - Token passthrough prevention
   - Confused deputy attack prevention
   - User consent validation
   - HTTPS enforcement

2. **Message Validation**
   - Request ID uniqueness
   - Null ID rejection
   - Result XOR error validation
   - Error code validation

3. **Streamable HTTP Session Management**
   - Session ID handling
   - DELETE termination
   - Connection resumability
   - Last-Event-ID support

4. **Batch Request Edge Cases**
   - Empty batch handling
   - Notification-only batches (202 response)
   - Mixed request/notification batches

5. **Transport-Specific Requirements**
   - stdio newline rejection
   - stdout/stdin isolation
   - HTTP status code handling

## Findings from Test Analysis

### Tests Successfully Extracted

The following MCP spec-related tests have been extracted from non-compliance files:

1. ✅ `cancellation_test.exs` - Protocol validation tests moved to `cancellation_compliance_test.exs`
2. ✅ `version_negotiation_test.exs` - Protocol negotiation tests moved to `version_negotiation_compliance_test.exs`
3. ✅ `roots_simple_test.exs` - Protocol compliance tests moved to `roots_compliance_test.exs`
4. ✅ `security_origin_validation_test.exs` - MCP security tests moved to `security_compliance_test.exs`

The original test files now contain only implementation-specific tests, while all MCP specification compliance tests are centralized in the compliance directory.

### Implementation Gaps Discovered

Through test analysis, we identified several features marked as ❌ (not tested) in the coverage matrix that have no tests anywhere in the codebase:

1. **Message Format Validation** - No request ID uniqueness or null ID rejection tests
2. **Batch Edge Cases** - No empty batch or notification-only batch tests
3. **Progress Percentage** - Progress tokens tested but not percentage validation
4. **stdio Requirements** - No newline rejection or isolation tests
5. **HTTP Session Management** - No session-related tests for Streamable HTTP

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Skipped Tests**: The 23 skipped tests across multiple compliance test files represent missing functionality that needs implementation:
   - 11 tests in `message_validation_compliance_test.exs` (request ID validation, response format validation)
   - 10 tests in `batch_edge_cases_test.exs` (empty batch handling, notification-only batches)
   - 2 tests in `security_compliance_test.exs` (token passthrough prevention, user consent validation)

2. **Follow TEST_PLAN.md**: Implement the phased approach outlined in the test plan:
   - Phase 1: Critical Security & Protocol Validation
   - Phase 2: Transport-Specific Requirements
   - Phase 3: Advanced Protocol Features
   - Phase 4: Draft-Specific Features
   - Phase 5: Backwards Compatibility

3. **Update Coverage Matrix**: As new tests are implemented, update `MCP_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` to reflect improved coverage

## Summary

The MCP compliance tests are now well-organized and centralized. With 241 tests currently in place (218 passing, 23 skipped) and clear documentation of what's missing, ExMCP is on track to achieve full MCP specification compliance. All protocol compliance tests have been successfully extracted from non-compliance files, creating a clean separation between MCP specification tests and implementation-specific tests. The skipped tests serve as a roadmap for remaining implementation work.
