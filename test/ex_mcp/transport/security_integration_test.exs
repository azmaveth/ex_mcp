  # These tests assume the existence of several helper modules:
  #
  # - `ExMcp.Security.SecurityGuard`: The security middleware being tested.
  #
  # - `ExMcp.Test.Support.Transports`: A helper module with functions to start
  #   and interact with test versions of each transport (HTTP, Stdio, BEAM).
  #   - Each transport helper is expected to return `{:ok, response, received_command}`
  #     on success, where `received_command` is the command as seen by the
  #     final handler (after middleware processing).
  #
  # - `ExMcp.Test.ConsentHandler`: A mock consent handler that allows setting
  #   consent status for specific tokens during tests.
