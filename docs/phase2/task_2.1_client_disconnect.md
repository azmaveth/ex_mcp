# Phase 2, Task 2.1: Client.disconnect/1 Implementation

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented `Client.disconnect/1` function that gracefully disconnects the client by:
1. Cancelling health check timers
2. Stopping the receiver task
3. Replying to pending requests with errors
4. Closing the transport connection
5. Updating the connection state

## Code Changes

### 1. Added `disconnect/1` public function (lib/ex_mcp/client.ex:282-296)
```elixir
@doc """
Disconnects the client gracefully, cleaning up all resources.

This function performs a clean shutdown by:
- Closing the transport connection
- Cancelling health checks
- Stopping the receiver task
- Replying to any pending requests with an error

## Examples

    {:ok, client} = ExMCP.Client.connect("http://localhost:8080/mcp")
    :ok = ExMCP.Client.disconnect(client)
"""
@spec disconnect(t()) :: :ok
def disconnect(client) do
  GenServer.call(client, :disconnect, 10_000)
end
```

### 2. Added `handle_call(:disconnect, ...)` implementation (lib/ex_mcp/client.ex:396-432)
```elixir
def handle_call(:disconnect, _from, state) do
  # Cancel health check timer
  if state.health_check_ref do
    Process.cancel_timer(state.health_check_ref)
  end
  
  # Stop receiver task by killing the process directly
  if state.receiver_task do
    if Process.alive?(state.receiver_task.pid) do
      Process.exit(state.receiver_task.pid, :shutdown)
    end
  end
  
  # Reply to all pending requests with error
  for {_id, from} <- state.pending_requests do
    GenServer.reply(from, {:error, :disconnected})
  end
  
  # Close transport connection
  if state.transport_mod && state.transport_state do
    try do
      state.transport_mod.close(state.transport_state)
    rescue
      _ -> :ok  # Ignore errors during cleanup
    end
  end
  
  # Update state to disconnected
  new_state = %{state | 
    connection_status: :disconnected,
    pending_requests: %{},
    receiver_task: nil,
    health_check_ref: nil
  }
  
  {:reply, :ok, new_state}
end
```

### 3. Updated `init/1` to support test mode (lib/ex_mcp/client.ex:330-333)
Added support for `_skip_connect` option to facilitate testing:
```elixir
# Check if we should skip connection (for testing)
if Keyword.get(opts, :_skip_connect, false) do
  {:ok, %{state | connection_status: :disconnected}}
else
  # ... normal connection process
end
```

## Tests Created

Created comprehensive test suite in `test/ex_mcp/client_disconnect_test.exs`:

1. **disconnect cleans up resources and updates state** - Verifies all resources are properly cleaned up
2. **disconnect handles pending requests** - Ensures pending requests receive error replies
3. **disconnect is idempotent** - Can be called multiple times safely
4. **requests fail after disconnect** - New requests return `:not_connected` error

All tests pass successfully ✅

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Graceful Cleanup**: The disconnect function properly cleans up all resources:
   - Timer cancellation for health checks
   - Task termination for receiver
   - Error replies for pending requests
   - Transport connection closure

2. **Error Handling**: Wrapped transport closure in try/rescue to prevent cleanup failures from breaking disconnect

3. **Task Termination**: Used `Process.exit/2` instead of `Task.shutdown/2` to avoid ownership issues

4. **State Management**: Properly updates all state fields to reflect disconnected status

## Usage Example

```elixir
# Connect to a server
{:ok, client} = ExMCP.Client.connect("http://localhost:8080/mcp")

# Use the client
{:ok, tools} = ExMCP.Client.list_tools(client)

# Disconnect gracefully
:ok = ExMCP.Client.disconnect(client)

# Requests after disconnect fail
{:error, :not_connected} = ExMCP.Client.list_tools(client)

# Can still stop the client process
:ok = ExMCP.Client.stop(client)
```

## Migration Notes

For users of legacy clients:
- `SimpleClient` and `ConvenienceClient` don't have disconnect - they use `stop/1` directly
- The new `disconnect/1` provides graceful cleanup before stopping
- Consider using `disconnect/1` before `stop/1` for cleaner shutdown

## Next Steps

With Task 2.1 complete, proceed to:
- Task 2.2: Implement Client.complete/3
- Task 2.3: Implement Client.log_message/3,4
- Task 2.4: Implement Server.list_roots/2
