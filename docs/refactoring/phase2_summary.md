# Phase 2: RequestTracker Extraction - Complete

## Summary

Successfully extracted all request tracking and cancellation logic from ExMCP.Server into a dedicated RequestTracker module.

## Changes Made

1. **Created `ExMCP.Protocol.RequestTracker`** (232 lines)
   - Manages pending requests with GenServer from references
   - Tracks cancelled request IDs
   - Handles request completion and cancellation lifecycle
   - Provides query functions for request status
   - Comprehensive documentation and type specs

2. **Created comprehensive tests** (264 lines)
   - 23 tests covering all functionality
   - Integration scenarios tested
   - All tests pass ✅

3. **Modified `ExMCP.Server`**
   - Added `alias ExMCP.Protocol.RequestTracker`
   - Replaced state initialization to use `RequestTracker.init_state/1`
   - Replaced all manual request tracking with RequestTracker calls
   - Simplified cancellation handling logic

## Test Results

- All 37 server tests pass ✅
- All 23 RequestTracker tests pass ✅
- No functionality changes
- Full backward compatibility maintained

## Request Tracking Patterns Replaced

1. **State initialization**: `RequestTracker.init_state(state)`
2. **Tracking requests**: `RequestTracker.track_request(id, from, state)`
3. **Completing requests**: `RequestTracker.complete_request(id, state)`
4. **Cancellation checks**: `RequestTracker.is_cancelled?(id, state)`
5. **Cancellation handling**: `RequestTracker.handle_cancellation(id, state)`
6. **Query pending requests**: `RequestTracker.get_pending_request_ids(state)`

## Benefits

- Clear separation of request lifecycle management
- Easier to test request tracking in isolation
- Reduced complexity in ExMCP.Server
- Reusable for other server implementations
- Type safety through specs

## Architecture Insights

The RequestTracker maintains two key data structures:
- `pending_requests`: Map of request_id => from (GenServer reference)
- `cancelled_requests`: MapSet of cancelled request_ids

Important: Cancelled requests remain in pending_requests until explicitly completed. This prevents race conditions where a cancellation arrives after request processing has begun.

## Next Steps

- Phase 3: Extract Protocol.RequestProcessor for request routing and processing
- Continue reducing ExMCP.Server complexity

## Metrics

- Lines removed from Server: ~40 (request tracking logic)
- Lines added to RequestTracker: 232
- Net complexity reduction: Significant (centralized tracking logic)
- Test coverage: 100% of RequestTracker functionality
